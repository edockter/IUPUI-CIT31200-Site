What’s the Big Idea?
 

Using CSS you will convert a multi-page website into a responsive site using CSS reset and media queries.

 

Instructions
 

Using the government agency/non-governmental organization website you produced previously, do the following:

COPY AND PASTE a version of your website into a new folder (you want to be sure you can go back to the previous version, and you MUST keep the versions separate on the web server.)

Implement the CSS reset of your choice (check the Modules Overview Page) to assist in making your site as cross-browser compatible as possible. Please do not just set the margins and padding to 0 as this will not be sufficient for this assignment.

Add the CSS media queries needed to make the site’s layout conform to the layout in the attached prototype for both a tablet and a mobile phone, in addition to the desktop(so, three media queries in total.)

*** Please look in the Discussions area as I have posted three previously submitted screenshots to get an idea or what to do.

CSS Exercise and Assignment Questions

All pages of the website must update their layout for all three viewports (if you structured the pages consistently during their initial development, this should be easy.)

Submitting Your Work
 

Your assignment submission consists of three components:

 

A ZIP file that contains ALL of the source code for your site (please ensure the site’s local root folder is the root of the ZIP file)

A link to the website’s home page on the university-provided webserver (please make sure the link you input on the assignment page is clickable)

THREE screen shots of the website in its three configurations (you can simply resize your browser window to demonstrate the updated layouts and take screen shots of the browser.)

 

Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date listed.
