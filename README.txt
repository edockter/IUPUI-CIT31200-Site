What’s the Big Idea?

 

Refresh your HTML skills and ensure that you are correctly structuring a desktop website using HTML5 and CSS.  This site will be used in upcoming assessments, so be sure to read the instructions carefully.




Instructions

 

You have been provided a “clickable” prototype in PDF format (just scroll if the clicks do not work.)  

 

Using HTML5 and CSS, construct a website that matches the layout provided in the prototype.

 

For this assignment you should create ALL of the pages in the attached prototype. CIT31200-HTML5-Prototype.pdfPreview the documentView in a new window (Note that the formatting of the subpages is incredibly similar, so this is not as overwhelming as it may seem.) I want to make a special note here in regards to the prototype the footer in the pdf is split into two divs this is not a requirement. Feel free to just use a simple footer. In addition to this the search feature is purely cosmetic and does not actually perform a search. Also to generate content use Lorem Ipsum so that we can have an idea of how content would fit on the page.

Lorem Ipsum generators:

http://ipsum-generator.com/ (Links to an external site.)

 

Your primary goals for this project are:

Use proper HTML5 elements to ensure the structure of the page and it’s Document Object Model (DOM) are organized.  Specifically, you will need to use the HEADER, FOOTER, and MAIN tags.

Use minimal CSS for positioning to ensure your page layout is correct.  That means that your pages won't look as fancy as the pages in the pdf but that comes later. We are really working on setting up the structural tags so we can focus on page layout and styling. THEN, if you like, go back and add styling.  You will improve the CSS in an upcoming project.

Ensure you use a SINGLE, EXTERNAL CSS file for the entire site.

 

You may:

Source images, photos, and logos from any source you wish (cite your source in your HTML comments.)  Yes this is legal, as copyright law allows for “fair use” of materials in an educational context.

Use images and photos that are watermarked

Manipulate images using a photo editor so that they fit a specific constraint or size

 

You may NOT:

Use a pre-supplied template or framework that you have obtained from another source.  Your code for this assignment must be 100% YOUR OWN WORK.  (We will find sources for starter projects later this semester.)

Use a server-side programming language (PHP, ASPX, etc.) for this course.  Yes, this will require some copying and pasting on your part.  No, it’s not like this in the real world.

Host the website on a personal server.  To be graded your assignment must be posted on the university server provided to you.




Submitting Your Work

 

Your assignment submission consists of two components:

 

A ZIP file that contains ALL of the source code for your site (please ensure the site’s local root folder is the root of the ZIP file)

A link to the website’s home page on the university-provided webserver (please make sure the link you input on the assignment page is clickable). Just put this link in the "comments" field for the file upload.

 

Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date.
