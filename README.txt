*CIT 31200*
**Assignment: Cross-Browser Compatible Website**
 

What’s the Big Idea?
 

Building on your government agency/non-governmental organization website, you will implement accessibility features as well as ensure that your website is cross-browser compatible (and supports some older browsers as well.)



Instructions
 

Starting with your government agency/non-governmental organization website, do the following:
 

Review comments on your informational website project thus far and make any suggested update
 

Add a contact form that allows users to register for more information via an HTML form (the form will not function.) (See more instructions below)



Additional Web Form Instructions
 

Your form must collect the following information:
First Name
Last Name
Email Address
5-digit ZIP Code (should be numbers only!)
Radio Buttons for gender
Dropdown selection for age range (18-30, 31-50, 51-70, 71+)
Make sure you take care and style your form by adjusting padding and margins as explained in this sitepoint article http://www.sitepoint.com/fancy-form-design-css-2/ (Links to an external site.). Make sure your form fields are intentionally placed on the page and avoid jumbled jagged forms.  (Yes I put that in bold.)

 

 (20 points)

Use the HTML5 form field elements to do some light error checking and include placeholder attributes.  All fields are required, the email address must be an email address, and the ZIP code must be numeric. At a minimum you must use the form attributes of Placeholder, Autofocus, and Required.
Write a one page summary including the steps that you would take to implement a poliyfill that will allow an older web browser to correctly view the web form. Include details about the specific fields of the HTML5 form and which attributes would appear or not appear on the page if using IE 6. Make sure to research and include a procedure for how you would check and verify that your polyfill is working correctly. (5 points)

 
 

Submitting Your Work
 

Your assignment submission consists of three components:
 

A ZIP file that contains ALL of the source code for your updated site (please ensure the site’s local root folder is the root of the ZIP file)
A link to the website’s home page on the university-provided webserver (please make sure the link you input on the assignment page is clickable)
A screenshot of your contact form in an Internet Explorer simulator
 

Assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date listed.
